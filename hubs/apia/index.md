The topics will be wide ranging and the attendees will be users, creators, business, academics, community mappers, and government.

# Who is going to be there?

This conference is aimed at a broad swath of the community – developers, users, contributors, community mappers, academics, business, government and anyone interested in open source geospatial software and the OpenStreetMap project.

# Why should I go?

You will learn about cutting edge tech and what's on the horizon, meet the experts and talk to them, and learn new skills.

Along the way you will meet up with old friends, make new ones, and share your experiences.
