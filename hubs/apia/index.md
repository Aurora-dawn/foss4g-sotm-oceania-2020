# FOSS4G SotM Oceania? Here's what it means.

So let's break it down — 'Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial' or FOSS4G if you're a fan of efficiency (we are) is the name given to the conferences of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). OSGeo is a non-profit with a mission to foster and promote the adoption of open source geospatial technology. All of this is done within the broader context of open source software philosophy and participatory community driven development.
'State of the Map' or SotM is the conference of the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) which supports the development of a free and open editable world map. This takes the form of the community driven OpenStreetMap project.

# What can I expect?

FOSS4G SotM Oceania belongs to you! It's the chance to come together as a community to share knowledge and experience through conference sessions, technical workshops, and social events. The topics will be wide ranging and the attendees will be users, creators, business, academics, community mappers, and government.
