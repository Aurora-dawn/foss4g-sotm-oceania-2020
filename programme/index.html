<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2020 is taking place online on <b>17 August 2020</b>. We have created an exciting program with youâ€”the FOSS4G and OpenStreetMap community. For the duration of the conference, we have chat rooms set aside for virtual sponsor booths as well as breakout sessions that can be booked by groups of mutual interest, or used without prior planning.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#general_Sunday">18 August</a>: day 2 of more presentations plus a whole track of academic talks selected by our <a href="../cfp/academic#committee">scientific committee</a></li>
